In order to Integrate Glasswall Desktop App Make sure Both of the Machine are on the same network subnet.

Ignore Step 1 to Step 3 If you are already using OfflineDesktop.ova

**Step 1:** Download Glasswall Desktop App from <https://github.com/k8-proxy/glasswall-desktop/releases/download/v1.0.5/glasswall-desktop-1.0.5.AppImage>

**Step 2:** Make the downloaded package as an executable by running below command.

```chmod a+x glasswall-desktop-1.0.5.AppImage```

**Step 3:** Run below command to launch the desktop application

```./glasswall-desktop-1.0.5.AppImage```

Example Value:

REBUILD ENGINE URL  = <GW-SDK-VM IP address along with port>/api/rebuild/base64

REBUILD ANALYSIS URL = <GW-SDK-VM IP address along with port>/api/Analyse/base64

Once you are done with the above setting you are using GW-SDK-VM now with Glasswall Desktop App to Process the files.
