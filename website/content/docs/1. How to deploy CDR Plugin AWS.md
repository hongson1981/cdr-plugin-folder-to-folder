## Deploying CDR Plugin on AWS

- Use latest CDR Plugin AMI.
   - AMI ID can be found in github actions: https://github.com/filetrust/cdr-plugin-folder-to-folder/actions/workflows/cdr-plugin.yml
- Login to AWS Console
- Navigate to AWS > AMIs
- Search for the AMI with specific ID from the first step (make sure you are in correct region)
- From AMIs workspace click on specific AMI > Choose `Launch`
- Set instance type to `t3.2x.large` and extend storage to at least `50GB` (in case you are planning to test large data sets set storage to higher value)
- Add any tags if needed
- Add security group if needed (for CDR by default nothing additional should be set)
- Click on `Review and Launch`
    - Select `Create or use existing key pair` [Note: Key is not needed for SSH at the moment]
- Wait for instance to be initialized (~10 minutes) and use public IP to access CDR Plugin VM
- SSH to your instance (password will be shared):
```
 ssh -L 8002:127.0.0.1:5601 -L 8001:127.0.0.1:8888 -L 8003:127.0.0.1:9000 -L 8000:127.0.0.1:8880 ubuntu@<VM_IP>
```
- From browser you can now access:
   - Minio: `localhost:8003`
   - Jupyter: `localhost:8001`
   - Elastic: `localhost:8002`
   - Swagger: `localhost:8000/docs`
   - Hugo: `localhost:8004`
- Main UI to use is: `localhost:8004`
