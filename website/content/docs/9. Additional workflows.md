## 1. Retry workflow

**Context**: 
- After running CDR F2F processing of specific scenario, rerun the scenario for failed files.

**Steps**:
- Run CDR F2F processing (CLEAR > LOAD > START)
- After processing is done verify the number and context of failed files
- Rerun CDR F2F processing (START)
- Verify the number and context of failed files

**Goal**:
- Number of failed files (if their failure is connected to GW SDK rather than Rebuild engine) is lower
- Come to a number of files for which processing fails due to specific Rebuild Engine error

## 2. Uploading the zip file via URL

**Context**
- Be able to directly add files via zip URL, import and pre process it

**Steps**
- Create scenario folder in cdr_plugin_folder_to_folder/test_data
- Create hd1, hd2, hd3 subfolders
- Go to CDR Plugin UI and in the Workflows set above folder as default
- Go to Swagger, find an API `/pre-processor/download_and_pre_process_a_zip_file`

- Pass the URL of the zip file you want to process (zip file URL can be any)

**Goal**

- Once API is executed, zip file will be unzipped and all files will be present and hd1 folder
- Files will be pre processed and present in hd2/todo folder
- Original zip file will be deleted
