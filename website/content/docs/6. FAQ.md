### 1. How to download rebuild file?

- From Minio
   - Access the `Minio` from you browser
   - Navigate to scenario you run, choose HD3
   - Select file you want and download
- From CDR Plugin VM
   - ssh to CDR Plugin VM
   - Navigate to `/home/ubuntu/cdr-plugin-folder-to-folder/test_data` and go to scenario you run, choose HD3 and download file
   - Copy file to local
- From Jupyter
   - Access the Jupyter from you browser
   - Navigate to `data` folder
   - Choose scenario you run, choose HD3 and download file

### 2. How to remove files form HD2 right after all files are processed?

- Within Jupyter Notebook, in `Work >Use Case 2` page set `clear_data` value
   - If `true` it will delete files from HD2 once they are all processed
   - If `false` it will leave the files in HD2

### 3. How to change CDR Plugin VM, volume size to accommodate more testing files?

- Change your CDR Plugin VM, harddisk size (as per interface on ESXI or AWS)
- Connect to your VM and run bellow commands
```
> df -h //checks system in use for each volume
> lsblk //checks if volume has partition that needs to be extended
> sudo growpart /partition/to/extend  //specify partition that you want to extend ex. sudo growpart /dev/xvda 1
> sudo resize2fs /dev/root //extends dev/root volume which is where files are being stored
```
- Check for [more details](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/recognize-expanded-volume-linux.html) 
- AWS example
```
sudo growpart /dev/nvme0n1 1
sudo resize2fs /dev/root
```

- ESXI example
```
sudo growpart /dev/sda 1
sudo resize2fs /dev/root
```

### 4. How to check which CDR Plugin version I am using?
### 5. How to check which GW SDK version I am using?
### 6. How to access Elastic and Kibana dashboards?
### 7. Where to find data sets for testing?

- Few example datasets can be found on: https://github.com/k8-proxy/data-sets/blob/main/README.md

### 8. How to count the number of files being processed or created in HD2/HD3 directly from CDR VM?

```
ls <folder path/name> | wc -l
ex. ls hd2 | wc -l
```

### 9. How to deploy CDR Plugin?
- Pick up latest CDR Plugin AMI id from github actions: https://github.com/filetrust/cdr-plugin-folder-to-folder/actions/workflows/cdr-plugin.yml
- Deploy AMI in AWS (t3.2x.large with corresponding tags and extend storage to at least 50GB)
- Deploy and use it
- In order to have latest changes within VM in cdr-plugin folder do git pull on the VM itself

### 10. How to connect to deployed CDR Plugin VM?
- From the folder where your ssh key is stored run:
```
 ssh -L 8002:127.0.0.1:5601 -L 8001:127.0.0.1:8888 -L 8003:127.0.0.1:9000 -L 8000:127.0.0.1:8880 -i <your_key>.pem ubuntu@<VM_IP>
```
- From browser you can now access:
   - Minio: `localhost:8003`
   - Jupyter: `localhost:8001`
   - Elastic: `localhost:8002`
   - Swagger: `localhost:8000/docs`

### 11. When trying to access the logs in Elastic getting an error for application_logs "Could not locate that index-pattern-field (id: timestamp)" 
![image (5)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/70108899/115782913-824a0400-a3bc-11eb-822c-910c6248e491.png)

- SSH to your CDR Plugin VM
- Within `cdr_plugin_folder_to_folder` directory run `docker-compose down` 
- Once all components are down run `docker-compose up`
- Once all components are up, from your browser, go to Jupyter notebook and start any scenario you want
- Go back to Elastic > Discover and check the logs (error should not be there and logs should be visible)
- Make sure that you run some scenario before verifying that error is not present
